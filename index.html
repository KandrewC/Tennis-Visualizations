        Visual Layout Selection:
      </h3>
      <p class="explanation left-align">
        <b>Using a bar chart:</b> A bar chart was optimal in displaying my data set because it allows
        for the easy comparison between two different values. One reaons that I leveraged a bar chart instead
        of a scatter plot in order to show my data was because I the bars connecting to the x-axis allowed for the 
        names of the matches to be more easily read and connected. With the match names being pretty long, there needed 
        to be more spacing between the text and the axis, this made it difficult to see what data points related to which 
        x-value. Another reason in utilizing the bar chart was that the x-axis was mainly the same, with only match names changing.
        Because of this, the y-axis is what contained most of the moving data. 
      </p>
      <h3 class="explanation left-align">
        Visual Encodings:
      </h3>
      <p class="explanation left-align">
             <b>Position:</b> Position is one of the strongest visual encodings. I utilized a common scale 
             in order to allow for quick comparisons between bars. Because the data was not sorted, 
             I utilized this common scale in order to allow viewers to quickly compare the tops of each bar with each other.
             The bars allow for easily checking if one statistic is higher than another 
      </p>
      <p class="explanation left-align">
             <b>Text Labels:</b> Because bar charts make it difficult to discern exact numbers, I added hover
             text that allows a viewer to see not only the number that is displayed, but also the opponent that 
             is being played against. This hover text contains the exact number shown in the graph, and allows for
             the viewer to be able to compare it to the other bars on the graph, as well as the opponent. 
    </p>
      <p class="explanation left-align">
             <b>Color:</b> In order to encode who won or lost a match, the bars are color-coded in green and red to show a win or loss
             respectively. The color of the bar corresponds to the first player in the match listed on the x axis. 

    <h3 class="explanation left-align">
        Control Features: 
    </h3>
    <p class="explanation left-align">
             The three groups of buttons are rounds, gender, and match statistics. I utilized radio buttons for the control features,
              because the visualization aims at providing information based on the combinations of these groups without crowding the dataset.
              If every single round could be shown, there would not only be an unreadable amount of bars on the chart, but also redundant names that 
              could confuse the viewer. 
    </p>
    <p class="explanation left-align">
             The first group of buttons is the rounds. Rounds are used to see the progression of the tournament, as well as to see if players 
             continue to progress through the tournaments with lower serve percentages and higher unforced errors. Being able to see the whole progression
             of a tournament allows for viewers to go through the tournament and explore how the trends throughout the tournament is. Furthermore, a 
             viewer is able to see if a tennis player continues to serve well throughout a tournament or has difficulty being consistent. 

             A question that I had when I was creating this dataset is do later rounds in a match have higher serve percentages or lower unforced errors 
             because of the assumed increase in skill level? Through exploring my visualization, I was able to discern that later rounds do not have necessarily
             higher server percentages or lower unforced errors. This could be due to many factors, such as already higher skill level equating to more errors, or
             potentially feeling more pressured to perform as the tournament progresses. These questions can continue to be explored through expanding on this
             visualization. 
    </p>
       <p class="explanation left-align">
             The second group of buttons is the gender. Gender is used to view between the men's bracket and the women's bracket. It is there
             to offer more insight about the tournament as a whole. Viewers may be curious as to if there are significant trends between men's 
             and women's tennis. Being able to compare these two groups allows for more comparisons. 

             A question that I had when working with this group of buttons is if women have a lower unforced error rate. Typically in tennis, women's rallies are much 
             longer. I was wondering if these longer rallies would correlate to less unforced erros. Through reviewing the visualization that women did seem to have a 
             smaller number of unforced errors. More research needs to be done, but I was excited to see how my visualization had helped been a step in answering this question.
    </p>
       <p class="explanation left-align">
             The third group of buttons is the first serve percentage and the number of unforced errors. This group of buttons allows for the most questions to be asked.
             They are there to help viewers gain insight into how these two categories can affect a win or loss. Typically in tennis, the higher the first serve percentage
             the better the chance of winning. This is because the serve is the only shot in the game where a player has full control of the point. It is usual seen that
             the higher the first serve percentage the higher chance for winning. Unforced errors are mistakes that players make. These mistakes often can happen due to pressure 
             or carelessness. The higher amount of unfored errors usually correlate to a higher chance of losing. 

             A question that I had when I was creating this dataset is whether there is a trend for higher serve percentage winning a game. Though I had always
             heard that the better you serve the higher chance you would win, I never had much data to back it up. This data showed that as a whole this was true. However
             I found it interesting that in the Men's Final between Rafael Nadal and Stan Wawrinka, that Nadal both served better and had less unforced erros, yet still lost. 
             This was an outlier that I had found compared to the common trend to the win/loss rate.
